Problem Scenario 93 : You have to run your Spark application with locally 8 thread or locally on 8 cores. Replace XXX with correct values. 

spark-submit —class com.hadoopexam.MyTask XXX \ 

--deploy-mode cluster SSPARK_HOME/lib/hadoopexam.jar 10 

Solution 

XXX : —master local[8] 

Notes : The master URL passed to Spark can be in one ot the following formats: 
Master URL Meaning 
local Run Spark locally with one worker thread (i.e. no parallelism at all). 
local[K] Run Spark locally with K worker threads (ideally, set this to the number of cores on your machine). 
localn [*]Run Sparkocally with as many worker threads as logical cores on your machine. 
spark://HOST:PORT Connect to the given Spark standalone cluster master. The port must be whichever one your master is configured to use, which is 7077 by default. 
mesos://HOST:PORT Connect to the given Mesos cluster. The port must be whichever one your is contigured to use, which is 5050 by default. Or, for a Mesos 
cluster using ZooKeeper, use mesos://zk://.... To submit with --deploy-mode cluster, the HOST:PORT should be configured to connect to the MesosClusterDispatcher. 
yarn Connect to a YARN cluster in client or cluster mode depending on the value ot --deploy-mode. The cluster location will be found based on the HADOOP_CONF_DIR or YARN_CONF_DIR variable.
