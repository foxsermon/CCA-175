18. Problem Scenario 18 : You have been given following mysql database details as well as other info. 
user=retail_dba 
password=cloudera 
database=retail_db 
jdbc URL = jdbc:mysql://quickstart:3306/retail_db 

Now accomplish following activities.

1. Create mysql table as below. 
mysql --user =retail_dba --password=cloudera 
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS departments_hive02(id int, department_name varchar(45), avg_salary int); 
show tables; 

2. Now export data from hive table departments_hive01 in departments_hive02. While exporting, please note following. wherever there is a empty string it should be loaded as a null value in mysql. wherever there is -999 value for int field, it should be created as null value.

mysql> select * From departments_hive02;
+------+-----------------+------------+
| id   | department_name | avg_salary |
+------+-----------------+------------+
|    2 | Fitness         |       NULL |
|    3 | Footwear        |       NULL |
|    4 | Apparel         |       NULL |
|    5 | Golf            |       NULL |
|    6 | Outdoors        |       NULL |
|    7 | Fan Shop        |       NULL |
|  777 | Not known       |       1000 |
| 8888 | NULL            |       1000 |
|  666 | NULL            |       1100 |
+------+-----------------+------------+
9 rows in set (0.00 sec)
udpate departments_hive01 set department_name = '' where department_name is null;

ERROR 1064 (42000): You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ‘udpate departments_hive01 set department_name = ‘’ where department_name is null’ at line 1

However, if created a new table dep with the same structure;
then copid all records from the hive01 table;
then did the same update command and it worked!

Conclusion: hive01 is a table derived from sqoop import from mysql to hive table,
