Problem Scenario 82 : You have been given table in Hive with following structure (Which you have created in previous exercise). 
productid int 
code string 
name string 
quantity int 
price float 
using SparkSQL accomplish following activities. 
1. Select all the products name and quantity having quantity <=2000 
2. Select name and price ot the product having code as 'PEN' 
3. Select all the products, which name starts with PENCIL 
4. Select all products which "name" begins with 'P', followed by any two characters, followed by space, followed by zero or more characters 

Solution . 
Step 1 : Copy following tile (Mandatory Step in Cloudera QuickVM) if you have not done it. 
sudo su root 
cp /usr/lib/hive/cont/hive-site.xml /usr/lib/spark/conf/ 
Step 2 : Now start spark-shell 
Step 3 : Select all the products name and quantity having quantity<=2000 
val results = sqlContext.sql( """SELECT name, quantity FROM products WHERE quantity 2000 """)
results.show() 
Step 4 : Select name and price of the product having code as 'PEN' 
val results = sqcontext.sql( """ SELECT name, price FROM products WHERE code = 'PEN' """) 
results.show() 
Step 5 : Select all the products , which name starts with PENCIL 
val results = sqcontext.sql(""" SELECT name, price FROM products WHERE upper(name) LIKE 'PENCIL%' """) 
results.show() 
Step 6 : select all products which "name" begins with 'P', followed by any two characters, followed by space, followed by zero or more characters
--"name" begins with 'P', followed by any two characters, 
--followed by space, followed by zero or more characters 
val results = sqcontext.sql( """ SELECT name, price FROM products WHERE name LIKE 'P_ %â€™ """) 
results.show()
