Problem Scenario 26 : You need to implement near real time solutions for collecting information when submitted in file with below information. 
You have been given below directory location (if not available than create it) /tmp/nrtcontent . Assume your departments upstream service is continuously committing data, because it is near real time solution). As soon as file committed in this directory that needs to be available in hdfs in /tmp/flume location. 
Write a flume configuration file named flume6.conf and use it to load data in hdfs with following additional properties . 
1. Spool /tmp/nrtcontent 
2. File prefix in hdfs sholuld be events 
3. File suffix should be .log 
4. If file is not commited and in use than it should have_as prefix.
5. Data should be written as text to hdfs 

Solution : 
Step 1 : Create directory 
mkdir /tmp/nrtcontent 
step 2 : Create flume configuration file, with below configuration for source, sink and channel and save it in flume6.conf. 
agent1.sources = source1
agent1.sinks = sink1 
agent1.channels = channel1

agent1.sources.source1 .channels = channel1 
agent1.sinks.sink1.channel = channel1
 
agent1 .sources.source1.type = spooldir 
agent1. sources. Source1.spoolDir = /tmp/nrtcontent 

agent1 .sinks.sink1.type = hdfs 
agent1.sinks.sink1.hdfs.path = /tmp/flume 
agent1.sinks.sink1.hdfs.fileprefix = events 
agent1.sinks.sink1.hdfs.fileSuffix = .log 
agent1.sinks.sink1.hdfs.inuseprefix = _
agent1.sinks.sink1.hdfs.fileType = DataStream
 
agent1.channels.channel1.type = file
 
step4: Run below command which will use this configuration file and append data in hdfs. 
Start flume service : 
flume-ng agent --cont /home/cloudera/flumeconf --conf-file /home/cloudera/flumeconf/flume6.conf --name agent1

Step 5 : Open another terminal and create a file in /tmp/nrtcontent 
echo "l am preparing for CCA175 from HadoopExam.com" > /tmp/nrtcontent/.he1 .txt 
mv /tmp/nrtcontent/.he1 .txt /tmp/nrtcontent/he1 .txt 

After few mins 
echo "l am preparing tor CCA175 from QuickTechie.com" > /tmp/nrtcontent/.qt1 .txt 
mv /tmp/nrtcontent/.qt1 .txt /tmp/nrtcontent/qt1.txt
